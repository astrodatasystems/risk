# Data Catalog — Kedro dataset declarations

# Naming convention follows the Medallion architecture:
#   01_raw      = Bronze (raw, untouched)
#   02_intermediate = Silver (cleaned, typed)
#   03_primary  = Gold (aggregated, business-ready)
#
# Intermediate DataFrames (bronze_combined, bronze_selected, etc.)
# are NOT listed here — Kedro keeps them in memory during the run.
# Only datasets that need to be persisted to disk are registered.
